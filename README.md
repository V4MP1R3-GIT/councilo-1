# COUNCILO - AN ONLINE COUNSELLING PORTAL
## A project by TEAM IMMORTALS
**COUNCILO** is an online portal where students and mentors can interact one-to-one, so that mentors could provide them better career guidance and proper paths to choose from. 
The main problem in today's education system is the lack of career guidance. Students don't get to know and explore various career options and hence go with the flow. This leads to loss in interest in that particular stream after a given time interval which further results in anxiety and depression in youngsters and sometimes it leads to suicides as well.
So there is a need to have proper councelling to the students from experienced people of the same field to tell them beforehand about the stream and its requirements.

## Working
We will ask students a set of 12 questions based on which a code will be formed which will explain his/her character trait. The questions will be divided into 4 subparts of 3 questions each and each subpart will result in one-fourth of the code. Hence the final code will be formed and based on that final code, we will suggest various career fields to the students. 
Moreover, to make the paths more clear, the students will be assigned individual mentors from whom they could ask questions and get answers. This will make sure that every doubt is accessed and cleared. 
The usage is not only limited to this, but personal mentors will also help student in choosing the correct stream after choosing the path. For example, engineering has various streams like computer science, mechanical, civil etc. Mentors will help students in choosing the best stream for them after assessing their interests and choices.

## Solution
This will help many students in choosing the right paths in their life. This website is also open sourced so anyone can contribute towards making this more efficient and hance it will lead to the goodness of more students. Moreover, as students will get fields according to their interests, they will enjoy learning them and later enjoy working in that field too.

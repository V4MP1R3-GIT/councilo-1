Councilo is a good web application and quite appreciable. It gives quite accurate results. The best thing about the application is that it not only gives possible career options but also provides all the information about the best institutions worldwide as well as the scope of the career and success achieved by different personalities after pursuing that career along with the afterlife of the person who pursues the career. I definitely support this app and recommend every student to use it at least once.
